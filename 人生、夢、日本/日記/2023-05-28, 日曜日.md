I've been camping these 2 days, fun experience ofc but i had this strange dream last night. I dreamed about a girl, I dreamed about this girl entering my room in the middle of the night. She's about my age, probably in her 24 or 25. She's wearing a blue dress, her light blue dress is short and loose-fitting, and she has a silver bracelet on her left wrist. Her dress has a rounded, open collar, showing off her well-formed neck. She's sitting at the desk, chin resting in her hands, staring at the wall and thinking about something. All of a sudden she stops gazing at the wall and turns in my direction. She reaches up and touches the hair at her foreheadâ€”her slim fingers rest for a time on her forehead, as if she's trying to draw out some forgotten thought. She's looking at me and then, without warning, this girl stands up and heads toward the door, the door is shut, yet soundlessly she disappears.  
  
She looks like a symbol of something. A certain time, a certain place
