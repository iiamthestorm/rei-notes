Im waking up at 4, sahur time, im eating mie indomie my sis made, it was delicious. Mie Indomie rasa ayam bawang i presume. It also has eggs! damn that food is bussin fr fr. And then i sleep after i pray subuh at wake up at 3 am bruh. Pitiful smh. And im being asked by my sister to buy some lada in kedai. And then i buka with some gorengan and tea and straight gobble up the sup daging my mom made, it was delicious fr. I love it. It also banyak lemak n stuff. And then i keep chilling until 1am, and i go to sleep at that time. 

I also integrated yomichan to anki so i can memorize what words in japanese i can memorize. It's good!. And then yea i went to imabi learning a bit of kanji. Probably that's the whole day

My mood is fine, i guess because im not wanking for a day i guess its nice! but still the horny thought lingering but i can do this, i can pass ramadhan
