## 名詞と代名詞
- The island chain to the north of 北海道, which is claimed by both Russia and Japan, is known as the Chishima Rettō 千島列島.
- Japan is divided into 47 state-like divisions called prefectures. They are collectively referred to with the term todōfuken 都道府県. -To 都 stands for capital and that prefecture is none other than Tōkyō-to 東京都 (The Tokyo Metropolis/Prefecture). -Dō 道 is an older word similar in use to "province" and the only one with this title is Hokkaidō 北海道, bearing the name of the island as a whole. There are two -fu 府 and they are treated as non-capital metropolitan areas. These metropolitan prefectures are none other than Ōsaka-fu 大阪府 and Kyōto-fu 京都府. All other prefecture ends in -ken 県.
- Watashi 私: All beginner texts will introduce this word as the basic word for "I." Without a doubt, it is the best equivalent that Modern Japanese has to offer. However, its overuse is problematic as Japanese speakers themselves hardly use it in sentences. When it does appear, the speaker is usually specifically bringing the focus of conversation on themselves. Overall, female speakers do tend to use it more than men in casual conversation as men prefer using other pronouns in those situations. Plural: Watashitachi 私たち
- Watakushi 私: わたくし is the preferred pronunciation of 私 in formal speech as it is the original form of the word. Like first person pronouns in general, it is not used constantly, but it is important to make sure you are pairing it with respectful language. Plural: Watakushitachi 私※
- Boku 僕: This pronoun is becoming the preferred pronoun for men of all ages, but there are situations in which women may be heard using it. The word has very humble origins, Japanese people in the past said “boku” to mean ‘servant’. Interestingly, this usage is still valid today. Actually, its kun’yomi, “shimobe”, is sometimes used to mean a servant or servants in the modern Japanese language. It is actually becoming more commonly heard even in honorific speech (by men only). Although the word is not 'gendered' per say, Japanese society does expect the speaker to be male for this word most of the time. Plural: Bokutachi 僕たち.
