so the best sentence would be 暑いである。in formal writing, not in spoken/texting language.

## か
- Question marking particle
- か is also often used to mark uncertainty/doubt
- Expressing uncertainty, but not a question, for example;
	1. 美味しいか分からない (I don't know if this is good or bad.)
	2. これは何か分からない (I don't know what this is.)
- か regularly comes after the polite form of words, such as ～ですか, ～ますか. However, in casual conversation か can be used directly after the word that the speaker is showing uncertainty about.
	1. 大丈夫ですか？
	2. 大丈夫か？
- か sentence without です may be considered rude by some people (as it sounds too familiar/direct).
- X＋(wa) は＋Y（Question Word）＋ga が＋ Z」, for example;
	1. 日本のどこが好きですか (what part of japan do you like?)
	2. 足のどこが痛いですか (what part of your legs hurts?)
	3. 日本のラメーンはどちらがいいですか？(which ramen in Japan is good?) (implies that the person asking the question is choosing between two or more options.)　
	4. 日本のラメーンは何がいいですか？(What kind of ramen in Japan is good?) (more open-ended. It's a broader question that doesn't necessarily imply a choice between specific options.)
	5. 果物は何が甘いですか (what kind of fruits is sweet?)
- The lack of desu です or -masu ます in forming questions in plain speech makes using ka か a little bit more tricky, largely because it's not used at all. Rather, a phrase usually becomes a question in plain speech by the use of raised intonation.
	1. 大丈夫？
	2. それは何？
	3. ペン、どこ？
	4. アメリアさん、どこにいく？
	5. これはいくつ？
- か can't be attached with だ, Therefore, だか is wrong and must be changed to either ka か or dropped entirely. This means it will always attach straight to nouns and adjectival nouns without the copula intervening. hence the word "大丈夫だか" is wrong.
- Secondly, ka か is primarily used in this fashion by male speakers among friends and or toward people of lower status. When it is used out of these arenas, you create a question that shows no reservation/modesty toward the listener. As such, it is typically favored by men in very casual situations among each other or whenever they are speaking to people inferior to themselves. If this pattern is used toward someone who is not one’s friend nor someone who has a lower status that oneself, the question will create a tone that borders on interrogation, making the speaker sound like a pompous brute, to say the least. For example;
	1. 大丈夫か?
	2. 君はあほか？
	3. あんた、行くか？(largely restricted to men in coarse conversation. )
- Say if the question isn't directed at anyone, but instead, you're talking to oneself or reacting to something and make a rhetorical question to that effect, then か loses its potency. As the following examples demonstrate, this applies to polite speech as well.
	1. もう時間（です）か。(It's already time, huh...)
	2. さ、行くか。(well, time to go)
	3. では、行きますか。(alright, time to go)
	4. ああ、そうか。(ah really?/ i see)
- You can't add か when asking in informal speech. Adding か will result in different meaning such as "some....". There is two options to handle this;
	1. Raising the intonation at the end of the word, for example 何？
	2. Follow the question word with the copula verb da だ. This option is preferred by men, especially in casual conversation. It must be noted, though, that the tone created is meant to be stern, and an angry tone can easily make the question sound rude and demanding.
	   
	For both options, speakers often add the particle yo よ to make the tone of the question more emphatic. As it is not what marks the sentence as a question, you can simply visualize it as a tack-on to the sentence. In the case of Option 1, the construction becomes feminized by the addition of yo よ as the sentence looks as if the more masculine da だ is omitted.
	
	For example;
	1. 何だ、これ？(what the heck is this?) (Sentence Note: This sentence is inverted, but reversing the predicate and subject like this is common in casual speech, especially with simple questions.)
	2. えっ、何よ！(Feminine) (Wh-what the heck?)
	3. 鍵はどこだ。(Where is the key!!?)
	   
	There are highly specific scenarios in which you may find a question word as the predicate followed by ka か, but as the next two examples illustrate, they are always very philosophical and rhetorical and not intended to necessarily be answered directly by the listener. For example;
	1. 人生とは何か。(What exactly is life as a human?)
	2. ウクライナが侵攻されたのは何故か？(Why is it that Ukraine got invaded?)

## の
https://bunpro.jp/grammar_points/%E3%81%AE
- の can be used for ownership, for example :
	1. 私の車
	2. ヨルシカの曲
	3. 私は夢
- の can showing a relationship between (A) and (B), for example :
	1. 今日の夜
- の is also often used in the same way as が, to highlight the subject of a statement. For example:
	1. 私の好すきなお酒はビールです。


```ad-caution
の is usually used after nouns, but can also be used after other types of words, specifically when it is transforming them into a noun-like phrase. This is called nominalization in English. We will cover this in detail in the の - Nominalization grammar point.

1. こっちに来ますか？(Will you come here? (Focused on movement of the listener))
2. ここに来ますか？(Will you come to this place? (Focused on the place being a non-moving thing))

## 来る
To come
- 来る will always have the particle に or へ attached to the location that someone ‘will come’, or ‘has come’.
- 来る will often be seen as 来ている when someone has come to a place and remains there. This is due to ている meaning ‘to exist in the state of an action’, rather than being exactly the same as ‘(A)~ing’ in English. Because of this, 来ている can mean either ‘to be somewhere that one has come’, or ‘to be coming’.
