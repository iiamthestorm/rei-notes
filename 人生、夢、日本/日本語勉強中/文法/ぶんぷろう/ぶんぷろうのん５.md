## か
- Question marking particle
- か is also often used to mark uncertainty/doubt
- Expressing uncertainty, but not a question, for example;
	1. 美味しいか分からない (I don't know if this is good or bad.)
	2. これは何か分からない (I don't know what this is.)
- か regularly comes after the polite form of words, such as ～ですか, ～ますか. However, in casual conversation か can be used directly after the word that the speaker is showing uncertainty about.
	1. 大丈夫ですか？
	2. 大丈夫か？
- か sentence without です may be considered rude by some people (as it sounds too familiar/direct).
- X＋(wa) は＋Y（Question Word）＋ga が＋ Z」, for example;
	1. 日本のどこが好きですか (what part of japan do you like?)
	2. 足のどこが痛いですか (what part of your legs hurts?)
	3. 日本のラメーンはどちらがいいですか？(which ramen in Japan is good?) (implies that the person asking the question is choosing between two or more options.)　
	4. 日本のラメーンは何がいいですか？(What kind of ramen in Japan is good?) (more open-ended. It's a broader question that doesn't necessarily imply a choice between specific options.)
	5. 果物は何が甘いですか (what kind of fruits is sweet?)
- The lack of desu です or -masu ます in forming questions in plain speech makes using ka か a little bit more tricky, largely because it's not used at all. Rather, a phrase usually becomes a question in plain speech by the use of raised intonation.
	1. 大丈夫？
	2. それは何？
	3. ペン、どこ？
	4. アメリアさん、どこにいく？
	5. これはいくつ？
- か can't be attached with だ, Therefore, だか is wrong and must be changed to either ka か or dropped entirely. This means it will always attach straight to nouns and adjectival nouns without the copula intervening. hence the word "大丈夫だか" is wrong.
- Secondly, ka か is primarily used in this fashion by male speakers among friends and or toward people of lower status. When it is used out of these arenas, you create a question that shows no reservation/modesty toward the listener. As such, it is typically favored by men in very casual situations among each other or whenever they are speaking to people inferior to themselves. If this pattern is used toward someone who is not one’s friend nor someone who has a lower status that oneself, the question will create a tone that borders on interrogation, making the speaker sound like a pompous brute, to say the least. For example;
	1. 大丈夫か?
	2. 君はあほか？
	3. あんた、行くか？(largely restricted to men in coarse conversation. )
- Say if the question isn't directed at anyone, but instead, you're talking to oneself or reacting to something and make a rhetorical question to that effect, then か loses its potency. As the following examples demonstrate, this applies to polite speech as well.
	1. もう時間（です）か。(It's already time, huh...)
	2. さ、行くか。(well, time to go)
	3. では、行きますか。(alright, time to go)
	4. ああ、そうか。(ah really?/ i see)

# の
https://bunpro.jp/grammar_points/%E3%81%AE
- の can be used for ownership, for example :
	1. 私の車
	2. ヨルシカの曲
	3. 私は夢
- の can showing a relationship between (A) and (B), for example :
	1. 今日の夜
- の is also often used in the same way as が, to highlight the subject of a statement. For example:
	1. 私の好すきなお酒はビールです。


```ad-caution
の is usually used after nouns, but can also be used after other types of words, specifically when it is transforming them into a noun-like phrase. This is called nominalization in English. We will cover this in detail in the の - Nominalization grammar point.
