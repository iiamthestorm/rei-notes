# What are all the online resources you're using?

I'm talking about apps, blogs, youtube channels, websites, etc. I'm trying to stack as many of them as possible but I couldn't find any posts on that here, there weren't that many things in the starter guide either.

##### Here are my free online resources:

- Ankiweb/anki: build your own digital flashcards  (website)
- Memrise: digital flashcards (website and app)
- Erin's Challenge: has a bunch of skits, with transcripts in romaji, kana, and kanji, as well as other activities (website)
- Hinative: good place to ask or find "how do you say ____" questions (website)(idk if app)
- HelloTalk: kind of like Facebook for language learning. Or like Lang8 (if it still exists) post in your target language and get corrections. (App) (idk if website)
- Tae Kim's guide to Japanese: a technical approach to Japanese grammar. Good if you like textbooks. (Website)
- Maggie Sensei: my personal go-to for grammar it's less technical and more fun and cutesy. (website)
- Tatoeba: gives example sentences for words (website)
- Jisho(.)org: japanese to english dictionary (website)
- refold(.)la : a guide for immersion based learning. (Website)
- All Japanese All The Time (AJATT): another personal fave. It's also a guide for massive immersion, and the one I mainly used. (Website)
- Takoboto: japanese to english dictionary (app)
- Tofugu: I love this website for all their topics on everything from culture to language. It's always an interesting read! Keep your eyes open for they frequently post their top-rated free resources! (Website)
- Duolingo: if used right it's a good way to rep your grammar, vocab, strengthen reading, and listening skills. The bad news is it's also really easy to cheat. Use the system right and there's much to be gained from it I promise. (App)
- Netflix: not really free, but if you've already got you can set a profile to Japanese and all Netflix originals will have Japanese dubs subs! (Best to keep all English out though)(app and website)
- Language Learning With Netflix: A chrome plugin that works with Netflix, it can show both Japanese and English subs at once, and has a hover dictionary!
- Rikaikun: Chrome plugin hover dictionary ⏤ by *BitterBloodedDemon* (↑ 82/ ↓ 0)

├── :) I've been at this a while.

Ironically, you stick at it long enough and you come full circle back to a dictionary and a grammar guide as your only resources. LOL. ⏤ by *BitterBloodedDemon* (↑ 13/ ↓ 0)
├─ Language Learning With Netflix is now called Language Reactor and also supports Youtube  videos. You can even search for Youtube/Netflix videos with japanese subtitles on their website. After Yomichan/rikaikun probably the best chrome addon for learning Japanese. ⏤ by *Sc2MaNga* (↑ 5/ ↓ 0)

##### Right now I use:

[https://jpdb.io/](https://jpdb.io/)

The website has many specific decks for Anime and other things. Those decks has all the vocab that is used in specific Anime etc. It also rates Anime on how difficulty of Japanese is used throughout the show. I use it to quickly learn the vocab and then watch the Anime on Netflix (Netflix Japan through VPN).

Together with Netflix I use the Chrome plugin Language reactor. ⏤ by *jqnsen* (↑ 20/ ↓ 0)
##### Wanikani users have made [the most comprehensive list of available resources](https://community.wanikani.com/t/the-ultimate-additional-japanese-resources-list/16859) I know of, including podcasts, blogs, etc etc. ⏤ by *[deleted]* (↑ 15/ ↓ 0)
##### * nyaa.si
* Library Genesis

##### As a dictionary I use jisho.org
To learn basic grammar and words when I first started I paid for thatjapanesecourse from a YouTuber named Yuta
After that I watched videos from もしもしゆすけ　(moshimoshi yusuke) which include Japanese and English subtitled videos where he walks around doing errands in Japan and newer videos having monologues and 1 on 1 conversations with a friend.
I also watch けんさんおかえり who does similar videos but some videos have only Japanese subtitle these are both on YouTube.
Lastly, I read よつばと！ (Yotsuba to!) which is a manga I ordered all available volumes at the time from amazon Japan and has furigana for the kanji so it is reader beginner friendly.
Obviously some of these items you have to pay for, however I think paid content is the fastest way to learn especially if you have a full time job and don’t have as much time. And the manga with furigana might be findable online.

The YouTube channels I stated are great free resources for listening and Japanese subtitle practice but I don’t think it is for early beginners knowing basic grammar first is probably better ( and obviously hiragana and katakana) ⏤ by *Luctose* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
##### (skipping ones mentioned so far) I've also used:  
Apps:  
Human Japanese ( Introduction/beginner lessons. Intermediate also available. $10, android)  
Kanji Tree (Kanji recognition, writing, free, android)  
Akebi (dictionary with many features, free, android)  
Lingodeer (subscription, android, iOS)  
Ankidroid (flashcards, free, android) I use Akebi add words w/ sentences to a custom deck also  
MochiMochi -learn kanji (subscription, android, iOS)  
Video:  
Cure Dolly (youtube. Some prefer to speed up playback)  
Website:  
DeepL  (translation)

##### I have an app called Renshuu that's pretty nifty. It's got graded learning and community practice. But my favorite part is the dictionary section. It's great for looking up words, kanji, grammar, and even a search just for sample sentences. The best part is the writing input tool, which holds the strokes up even if you're not done and even if you get off the app. It's got other perks that aren't free like pitch lessons, but I defo recommend it. ⏤ by *ValhallaStarfire* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
##### Some gems that I think worth mentioning:

Japanese From Zero is a neat bite-sized video lessons channel. George is probably the most fun teacher in any Japanese lesson videos IMO.

Game Gengo is more like a Japanese immersion channel from video games. Also, they have complete N4 and N5 grammar and vocab recap videos.

Japanese Ammo with Misa is what I use if I want to study grammar in-depth.

Imabi is website for really really in-depth lesson. I would recommend it only if you have a little grip on Japanese.

Then you got the sites that always appear when you search any Japanese questions. Top 3 are Tofugu, Maggie-sensei, and Kawa Kawa Learning Studio.

I don't recommend studying with ONLY apps so not gonna mention apps. They are just a supplement. Get a good textbook, kay? ⏤ by *LimoPanda* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
##### I think you'll find a good amount of great resources on here. One thing I'd like to add which I learned quite late was searching google with Japanese Keywords. For example, if you just read say an N4 level article on 日本経済、just search 日本経済+ nhk easy and surely you'll find articles, listen to it, read it, see the related articles, see the kanjis that are frequent and so on. ⏤ by *PUMPupMAN* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
##### By resources, you mean for learning or for immersion? I'll assume it's for learning.

Yomichan counts? Some grammar guides I find online, some people on discord who know more than I do. ⏤ by *ConsequenceOk9* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
##### Anki, kanji.koohii.com, and satori reader are my current ones. Previously used Lingodeer for N5 and N4. Occasionally used japanesepod101 but replaced it with satori reader. ⏤ by *ThePowerfulPaet* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
##### Me, a N3-ish Japanese learner who focus on vocabulary building and listening comprehension, and here's my recent daily routine:

##### Right now, I'm using Tae Kim's site, LingoDeer, Human Japanese, Anki, and Memrise. Really really loving them all so far! ⏤ by *firestoneaphone* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
##### For youtube my faves right now are: 
1. あかね的日本語教室 on youtube. I learn alot from her vlogs because she shows real things in japan and records common interactions. 

2.  Japanese ammo with misa. Shes so funny and explains things really well with lots of examples. 

Theres an online extension called language reactor, it gives you subtitles on youtube and Netflix in both your target language and language you speak in.

The only apps I use right now are Yomiwa and YuSpeak   I’ve tried sooo many but those are the only ones that i like. ⏤ by *Switcxblades* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
##### Innovative Language (Japanesepod101) and Memrise for now.

Just started so my focus is on getting Hiragana mastered. Also trying to avoid information overload. ⏤ by *TheMaverickAmorist* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├─ If you like Japanesepod101 I recommend satori reader once you get N5 and N4 under your belt. ⏤ by *ThePowerfulPaet* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
├── Thanks for the recommendation. 👍
After hiragana my next step will be sentence mining. ⏤ by *TheMaverickAmorist* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)

##### Jisho as general use dictionary, with jisho-pitcher extension to add pitch accent patterns. 

Kakijun.jp - I don’t think many people use this but I like it for cursive font references. 

Iknow website’s core 6000 deck. I don’t use the actual entries, I just use it as a guide for which words to learn (which I do on jisho), because it is based on frequency. Sometimes if the jisho entry lacks an audio file I’ll play the audio from the iknow entry. ⏤ by *rhsfkehjd* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### I use MochiMochi, Wanikani, Tae Kim’s guide to Japaanese, and I like to look up random Youtube channels that help with speaking slow-ish Japanese so I can get an idea of how sentences sound to natives. I’m still a pretty new Japanese learner though. ⏤ by *linkusblue* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### I recently started using Tadoku. It’s a website that has a bunch of free reading material for all levels. For example, level L0 (easiest) contains short picture books. Usually a sentence or two on each page with an image. Here’s an example book - https://tadoku.org/japanese/book/8757/#bd-look-inside ⏤ by *panda_117* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### I am french so I don't think Cours de japonais could help you if you're not french but I watch Dogen's videos and I use JapaneseTest4You to test my level (N5 tbh). I use the japanese keyboard of lexilogos to write sentences. ⏤ by *LeFrench_DeezNuts* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### Bite size Japanese

Duolingo:for vocabulary/for fun 
Tandem:to talk to natives

##### I recently discovered a channel called Nihingo to tabi. For me it is really useful for learning grammar because I have a hard time remembering when I study from books. The videos are around 4 mins each focusing on one grammar point ⏤ by *vanisle_frenchie_mom* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### I just use
Jisho.org
Anki
YouTube
Animelon

For learning Japanese
Anime on YouTube is nice it has extremely long sentences
混血のかれこれ is my favourite it's for children but it's fine ⏤ by *asashikashi* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### Others have listed everything else, but one i use is the app KawaiiNihongo and it's sister app KawaiiDungeon ⏤ by *Jesniha* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### I've been liking JPDB for studying, it's a flashcard site but you can import sentences so it'll create decks based on those words. I've been using it for learning words I'll encounter on video games I want to play, like Prof Layton, there are sites that have the puzzles and solutions, I just copy and paste the entire thing, for as many as I can, and JPDB will pull out words from there. They also have decks already on there from stuff like the JLPT and books, like if you were trying to read Harry Potter or something. ⏤ by *FFXIVpazudora* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### Archive.org has loads of textbooks available that you can borrow for free.  It’s a great place to look if you want a legal means of accessing a textbook without having to pay potentially exorbitant amounts of money for it.  It’s also fun (if, perhaps, not particularly helpful) to look through old 19th and early 20th century textbooks in the public domain and see how the language has evolved since they were written.

I’m personally working my way through Jorden’s Japanese: The Spoken Language via the website.  Not everyone’s first choice of textbook, but it’s the one I clicked with after exploring several other options. ⏤ by *ExquisiteKeiran* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### https://kotu.io/tests/pitchAccent/minimalPairs is an important pitch accent resource I don't see a lot of people talk about. You need an account but it's free. ⏤ by *tesseracts* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### I’m using duolingo and learn Japanese 101.com ⏤ by *Sheenthefox9292* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
##### 物書堂：「精選版 日本語国語大辞典」、「大辞林 第4版」、「大辞泉 第２版」、「新明解国語辞典 第8版」、「三省堂国語辞典 第8版」、「明鏡国語辞典 第3版」、「NHK 日本語発音アクセント新辞典」、「角川類語新辞典」、「漢検 漢字辞典 第2版」
