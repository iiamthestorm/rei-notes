im sweating and anxious of myself. Whenever i see people that have money and can wear a good clothes i simply cannot refuse the fact that im a broke man. 

I want to have sort of things too. I felt like i'm just nothing compared to these guys. They made me aware of my own inadequecy.

there is always constant battles between feelings and rationality in my head.. whether i have to accept the truth that i'm in fact broke and no one bats an eye on me or just simply refuse this negative thoughts and called them shallow.
