Today i'm continueing making dungeon on blender 3D
Today i've done making the second barrel and now im going to make a crate by :
1. extrude faces along normals (alt + e)
2. if you want to bevel the vertices, then you can bevel (ctrl + b) and then press v for vertices.
3. you can also join the vertices together by clicking (j)
