Logic is the art of evaluating one's argument, sorting the good ones from the bad ones.

Argument in Logic isn't an exchange of diverging or opposite views, typically a heated or angry one. In Logic we're not interested with teeth-gnashing, hair-pulling kind of argument.

A Logical Argument is structured to give someone a reason to believe some conclusion. Here's one such argument:
1. It is raining heavily.
2. If you don't take an umbrella, you will get soaked.
.˙. You should take an umbrella.

.˙. means "Therefore" or indicate the conclusion of the argument.

# Arguments
When analyzing arguments, the first thing that we have to do is to separate the premises from the conclusion.

premise indicators : since, because, given that
conclusion indicators : therefore, hence, thus, then, so

To be perfectly general, we can define argument such as a series of sentences, like this :
- The sentences at the beginning of the series are premises :
	1. It is raining heavily.
	2. If you don't take an umbrella, you will get soaked.
- The final sentence in the series is the conclusion :
       .˙. You should take an umbrella.   

Another example :
1. There is coffee in the coffee pot.
2. There is a dragon playing bassoon on the airmoire.
.˙.
