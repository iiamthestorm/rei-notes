So the one and the foremost thing to answer is to judge whether life is or is not worth living.

- I thought Galileo Galilei is killed by church because of his findings considered heresy. 
- People die because they judge that life is not worth living. The explanation about getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for living is: a reason for living can be anything you believe that gives meaning to life, like, as an example, you believe that God created you with a purpose, so you live because of this, and it can also be a reason for dying because you can also say that your purpose was to be a suicide bomber. Or the most common argument between existentialists at the time, life has no meaning, so there is not reason to live, or life has no meaning, so the reason to live is to create your own meaning.
