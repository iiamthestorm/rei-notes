- For Camus, this meant working for “a worldwide abolition of capital punishment.” While Camus never expected to live in a world where there would be no killing, he argued that killing can never, must never, be justified. As he saw it, all killing is murder, and he found legal, efficient, institutionalized murder the most abhorrent.
- Camus never saw himself as a philosopher. He was certainly no academic. He came from poverty, from “ordinary” people, and it was to them he was most concerned to speak.

- He was expected to embody The Stranger while he was writing and still living The Plague. The truth, as we will soon see, is that he was never Meursault, never indifferent to an Arab’s murder or a mother’s death, and would never have wished for howls of hatred at anyone’s execution, much less his own.
- but also that in his youth he had spent so much time in silence, studying ancient philosophy, and returning each day to a silent home, convincing him to his core that life’s most profound truths lay beyond the reach of words. This was one of the gulfs dividing him from Sartre, who revealingly entitled his autobiography Les Mots (The Words). Sartre’s coming of age, his mind’s birth, took place in his grandfather’s library, where he learned to read, consume, and configure words. Camus, in contrast, grew up in an impoverished, illiterate household, along with his cancerous grandmother, hearing-impaired mother, marginally educated older brother, and partially paralyzed uncle. Their congested two-room flat was without running water, much less a library. A world not only without books but also largely without words.
- Camus’s most intimate relationship was with his mother, an unschooled house cleaner who rarely spoke from the moment she learned of her husband’s death in the First Battle of the Marne. Whether from shock or choice, or both, she and Camus communicated and shared their lives with few words.
- Whereas for Sartre something was real and understood only when put into words, for Camus the more real or profound the truth, the less it could or need be spoken.

- Like the soul, our humanity is both innate and elusive. Its existence is a truism, eluding positive proof. We may only witness it in its absence. We may only experience it when we feel it slipping away.

- At this point Camus would have embarked on a career in university teaching had not his tuberculosis permanently closed that path to him. The same impairment would exclude him from military service, as well as cancel his early aspirations to play professional soccer. The young Camus, like his mentor, would instead, and to the benefit of many, become a writer.
- Camus, at eighteen, who had flourished in poverty and survived a collapsed lung, was nothing if not kindling, and Grenier lit the match. “Grenier,” Camus once remarked in an interview, “gave me a taste for philosophical meditation.”5 A taste that led to hunger. In the ensuing years, under Grenier’s tutelage, Camus consumed mounds of philosophy and literature, whatever Grenier piled on his plate and whatever he found on his own

- From the poverty that each of them knew as children there was but one escape—education—

- while his early essays and the posthumous First Man paint a vivid picture of his experiences as a growing boy “placed halfway between poverty and the sun.”
- So, too, there was the experience of pervasive poverty, with all the daily hardships and humiliations it entailed, and the experience of death, the death of a father he never knew, and a taste of his own death when barely seventeen, a death that he would carry with him for the duration. As we will soon see, these experiences led him to common ground with the Greeks and Augustine, and decisively shaped his future work.

- if he, as a human being, had a nature, he would do well to live in accord with it, as would everyone else. It made simple, common sense that to violate your own nature would be folly and would carry a heavy price.IV This inquiry into the nature of human being—so fundamental to ancient Greek and early Christian philosophy—formed the core of Camus’s most enduring and consequential writings, from The Stranger to The Fall.

Humans—halfway between the two—are as finite as beasts and as rational or conscious as gods, and in this they are unique. The gods, in Greek literature, are “deathless” (άθάνατοι); animals are “perishable” (ϕθαρτοί). Humans, on the other hand, are uniquely “deathful” (qnhtoiv). As Heidegger put it, human being is “Being-towards-death” (Sein-zum-Tode). In addition to being alive, we are, in every moment of life, also in the process of dying; and we know it, however far off the actual moment of our death might be. Knowing this, however, is not the same as daily living with it.

“I know another truism: it tells me that man is mortal,” wrote Camus. “One can nevertheless count the minds that have deduced the extreme conclusions from it.”25 As Camus pointed out, most people live in denial of death, in particular their own death, as long as they are able to run or distract themselves from it. Life offers countless escapes from the consciousness of death, but none from death itself. If the experience of death were required to become conscious of mortality, no one would ever achieve it, since death marks the cessation of consciousness.

We need only to use our imaginations to see ourselves in others—in the sick, the aged, and the dying—to realize that we will one day be them.

Why, we might ask, would we want to live with the consciousness of death, our death? The simple Greek answer to this is that our humanity depends on it. Ready or not, we are mortals, and when we pretend and act as if we are not, we all too often adopt the postures and presumptions of gods. Our imagined ascent into divinity, however, is in truth a never-ending descent.

I mean do you know what it means to be human? I don’t think you do. Anyway, you listen to me. We all gotta die. There ain’t one of us alive today That knows whether he’ll be around tomorrow…. So there, that’s it. You heard what I got to teach…. When you’re mortal, you gotta think mortal thoughts.

At the worst of his illness, the doctor showed no hope for him. He had had no doubts about it. Besides, the fear of death troubled him considerably.

For the seventeen-year-old Camus, mortality was no casual truism. If not before, from that time on he “thought mortal thoughts.” He had learned an essential truth, a “noble truth,” and would live it. He carried his death around with him and felt its presence with every breath.

Philosophy, Camus once commented, used to teach us how to die, but now it only teaches us how to think. Modern philosophy, all too often, is an effete, low-stakes parlor game for members only. Not so for Camus, who felt uncomfortable in the presence of French intellectuals. “Uncomfortable! That’s hardly the word for it,” commented Camus’s close friend Germaine Brée. “Camus came to feel almost physically distressed in their presence.”

When, with one collapsed lung, Camus resumed his studies and received his baccalaureate degree, he found the course of his life permanently altered. He would never teach, serve in the military, or tend his soccer team’s goal. Instead, for the remainder of his life, he would mostly sit at a desk, read, and write, in relative solitude.

For the next several years Camus continued his university studies, receiving certificates in sociology and ethics, psychology, classical literature, and logic and general philosophy, culminating in his thesis, “Christian Metaphysics and Neoplatonism,” for which he was awarded the diplôme d’études superieures. At the same time, he honed his writing skills and published his first two volumes of essays, entitled L’envers et l’endroit (The Wrong Side and the Right Side) and Nuptials, in humble print runs of 350 copies each. Neither book made an appreciable ripple, much less a splash. What they did do was launch a life.

“People can think only in images. If you want to be a philosopher, write novels.”

he revealed that he was already mapping out the first cycle of his work that would include The Stranger, The Myth of Sisyphus, Caligula, and The Misunderstanding (a novel, a philosophical essay, and two plays). Each cycle would have its own distinct patron or paradigm drawn from Greek myth and its own focal idea or concept. For the first cycle, in which Camus would address the “absurd,” he chose Sisyphus as his patron
