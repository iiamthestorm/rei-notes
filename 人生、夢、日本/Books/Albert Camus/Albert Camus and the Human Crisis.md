- For Camus, this meant working for “a worldwide abolition of capital punishment.” While Camus never expected to live in a world where there would be no killing, he argued that killing can never, must never, be justified. As he saw it, all killing is murder, and he found legal, efficient, institutionalized murder the most abhorrent.
- Camus never saw himself as a philosopher. He was certainly no academic. He came from poverty, from “ordinary” people, and it was to them he was most concerned to speak.

- He was expected to embody The Stranger while he was writing and still living The Plague. The truth, as we will soon see, is that he was never Meursault, never indifferent to an Arab’s murder or a mother’s death, and would never have wished for howls of hatred at anyone’s execution, much less his own.
- but also that in his youth he had spent so much time in silence, studying ancient philosophy, and returning each day to a silent home, convincing him to his core that life’s most profound truths lay beyond the reach of words. This was one of the gulfs dividing him from Sartre, who revealingly entitled his autobiography Les Mots (The Words). Sartre’s coming of age, his mind’s birth, took place in his grandfather’s library, where he learned to read, consume, and configure words. Camus, in contrast, grew up in an impoverished, illiterate household, along with his cancerous grandmother, hearing-impaired mother, marginally educated older brother, and partially paralyzed uncle. Their congested two-room flat was without running water, much less a library. A world not only without books but also largely without words.
- Camus’s most intimate relationship was with his mother, an unschooled house cleaner who rarely spoke from the moment she learned of her husband’s death in the First Battle of the Marne. Whether from shock or choice, or both, she and Camus communicated and shared their lives with few words.
- Whereas for Sartre something was real and understood only when put into words, for Camus the more real or profound the truth, the less it could or need be spoken.

- Like the soul, our humanity is both innate and elusive. Its existence is a truism, eluding positive proof. We may only witness it in its absence. We may only experience it when we feel it slipping away.
