# Important Notes
## Phenomenology means
Aron may have been saying something like this: traditional
philosophers often started with abstract axioms or theories, but the
German phenomenologists went straight for life as they experienced
it, moment to moment. 

They set aside most of what had kept
philosophy going since Plato: puzzles about whether things are real or
how we can know anything for certain about them. Instead, they
pointed out that any philosopher who asks these questions is already
thrown into a world filled with things — or, at least, filled with the
appearances of things, or ‘phenomena’ (from the Greek word meaning
‘things that appear’). 

So why not concentrate on the encounter with
phenomena and ignore the rest? The old puzzles need not be ruled
out forever, but they can be put in brackets, as it were, so that
philosophers can deal with more down-to-earth matters.
