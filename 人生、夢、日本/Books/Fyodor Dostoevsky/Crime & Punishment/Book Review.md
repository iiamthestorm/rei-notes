â€¢ Genres: Russian Literature, Classics Literature, Psychological Fiction, Philosophical Fiction, Dark, Slow-Paced.
â€¢ 564 pages.

This might be the first classic book that I have had no trouble reading whatsoever. I didn't have to force myself to read it because I instantly liked the theme this book offers. Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky are often regarded as the best translators, so I chose theirs.

It's unquestionably worthwhile to read. For the most part, it didn't feel lengthy. There may have been a few sections that are often the case with longer books that dragged, but, in the end, it's commendable.

The book's plot is self-explanatory, as the title suggests. There's a main character who commits a crime and is destined to receive his punishment. It raises some deep philosophical questions that might be a bit beyond my understanding but are nonetheless fascinating to think.

The time setting of the book, 'Crime and Punishment,' is crucial to its atmosphere and themes. Set in 19th century St. Petersburg, Russia when the society was characterized by a rigid social hierarchy and a flourishing of intellectual and philosophical movements.

The self-centeredness, depravity, depression, destitution, and nihilism of the surrounding characters really highlight how our moral progress hasn't kept pace with our impressive technological advancements as a society.

Prior to reading, I had some basic and just a tad grasp of the book's theme (a criticism of utilitarianism, rational egoism, and nihilism), but I wasn't anticipating its profound psychological insight.

How one might wonder, could Dostoevsky so brilliantly portray the paranoid psyche of a murderer, given that he himself never committed such an act? I was amazed by the skill and clarity with which Dostoevsky portrayed his characters.

I actually got a real sense of the anxiety the main character felt as he became more and more guilt-ridden and unhinged.

There's also a profound particular quote in the book that goes:

Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.

I thought that Dostoevsky himself had made that quote because he was making an observation, considering some of the people around him as intelligent and noticing that they were sad, unwanted, and depressed.

But what's ironic in all of this is that life is full of grief and suffering. It's an inherent aspect of existence, and Dostoevsky is either suggesting that we all possess intelligence or failing to recognize that his pain isn't inherently more or less meaningful than anyone else

I'm pleasantly surprised that this book is arguably more readable than many contemporary English novelists, such as Dickens. You can't imagine how challenging it was to read Dickens. I vividly recall my struggle with 'A Tale of Two Cities.'

The ending is great. I let out a deep sigh of relief as if an unresolved musical motif that had been present throughout the entire book had finally reached its resolution at the end. It's astonishing how Dostoevsky managed to maintain that tension for over 500 pages.

This book is depressing but incredible and beautifully done. All in all, I believe this book has imparted numerous lessons, prompted deep reflections, and provided immense enjoyment throughout my reading journey and I can't wait to reread it!

So yes!

I would rate this book,

ðŸŒŸ4.75/5
