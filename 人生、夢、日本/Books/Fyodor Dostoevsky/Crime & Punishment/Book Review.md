# C&P Book Review
Now, i want to say that this is the first classics book that i have no trouble to read whatsoever.. i don't really forced myself to read this because i just instantly likes the theme of this book offers. 


In my opinion, Crime and Punishment sometimes cited as one of the first psychological thriller with some religious overtones.
