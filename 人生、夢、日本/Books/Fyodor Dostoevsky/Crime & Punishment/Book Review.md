# C&P Book Review
This might be the first classic book that I have had no trouble reading whatsoever. I didn't have to force myself to read it because I instantly liked the theme this book offers. Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky are often regarded as the best translators, so I chose theirs.

It's unquestionably worthwhile to read. For the most part, it didn't feel lengthy. There may have been a few sections that are often the case with longer books that dragged, but, in the end, it's commendable.

I'm pleasantly surprised that this book is arguably more readable than many contemporary English novelists, such as Dickens. You can't imagine how challenging it was to read Dickens. I vividly recall my struggle with 'A Tale of Two Cities.'

The book's plot is self-explanatory, There's a main character who commits a crime and is destined to receive his punishment. It raised some deep philosophical questions that might be a bit beyond my understanding but are nonetheless fascinating to think about.
