# C&P Book Review
This might be the first classic book that I have had no trouble reading whatsoever. I didn't have to force myself to read it because I instantly liked the theme this book offers. Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky are often regarded as the best translators, so I chose theirs.


In my opinion, Crime and Punishment sometimes cited as one of the first psychological thriller with some religious overtones.
