"The student refers to utilitarianism by saying that murdering the good-for-nothing Alyona and using her money to uplift thousands of lives from “decay and corruption” would be very significant and make up for one “tiny little crime” (69).

The officer agrees that Alyona doesn’t deserve to live, but he also believes that it’s not in the peoples hands to get rid of her.

To which the student replies that not killing her would be unjust, but when the officer asks him if he would kill Alyona, he says no, so the officer says that there is no point in talking about it then, because justice won’t be served anyway.

This ties into the idea of natural order vs utilitarianism. Should the people take an initiative to bring justice to the society, or should they just let it be, let time and nature do the healing?"
