## Built-in browser functions

We've used functions built in to the browser a lot in this course.

Every time we manipulated a text string, for example:
```js
const myText = 'I am a string';
const newString = myText.replace('string', 'sausage');
console.log(newString);
// the replace() string function takes a source string,
// and a target string and replaces the source string,
// with the target string, and returns the newly formed string
```
Or every time we manipulated an array:
```js
const myArray = ['I', 'love', 'chocolate', 'frogs'];
const madeAString = myArray.join(' ');
console.log(madeAString);
// the join() function takes an array, joins
// all the array items together into a single
// string, and returns this new string
```
Or every time we generate a random number:
```js
const myNumber = Math.random();
// the random() function generates a random number between
// 0 and up to but not including 1, and returns that number
```
We were using aÂ _function_!

## Functions versus methods
Functions that are part of objetcs are called methods.
