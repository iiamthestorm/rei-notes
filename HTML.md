HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.
An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with [elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element). Elements are surrounded by matching opening and closing [tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tag). Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (`<>`). There are a few empty or _void_ elements that cannot enclose any text, for instance [`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img).
After learning HTML, you can then move on to learning about more advanced topics such as:

-   [[CSS]], and how to use it to style HTML (for example, alter your text size and fonts used, add borders and drop shadows, layout your page with multiple columns, add animations and other visual effects).
-   [[JavaScript]], and how to use it to add dynamic functionality to web pages (for example, find your location and plot it on a map, make UI elements appear/disappear when you toggle a button, save users' data locally on their computers, and much more).
